kermit's ~/.*
=============

After looking at the many [interesting dotfile solutions](http://dotfiles.github.io/),
I decided to go the build-your-own-lightsaber road after all. So here goes...

TODO:
----

- add emacs config kermit666/kermit-emacs

DONE:
-----

- install script - something like http://blog.smalleycreative.com/tutorials/using-git-and-github-to-manage-your-dotfiles/

Thanks!
