AutoKey-Emacs
==============

My [Autokey](https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/autokey-gtk/) settings to change the keybindings in Ubuntu that makes typical Emacs movement accessible everywhere.

                    ctrl+p
    ctrl+a  ctrl+b          ctrl+f  ctrl+e
                    ctrl+n

To achieve this, a remapping of the old functions (new window, tab, print, select all, ...) was also done so that they are accessible through the `alt` key (`alt+n`, `alt+t` etc.)

A list of apps that are not included (Emacs itself obviously, but also some others where you wouldn't wanna mess with the bindings) is defined in the `combo.py` script.
